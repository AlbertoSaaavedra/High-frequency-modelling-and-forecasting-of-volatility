# High-frequency modelling and forecasting of volatility on FX markets

### Contents

This repository contains some elements of the work I carried out during the development of my MSc Thesis at Imperial College London. Specifically, in this repository you can fin:
- Sample codes of the programming I did to estimate and forecast volatility using high-frequency data from the Forex Exchenge (FX) market.
- Sample of the data I used for this research, which is freely available at [TrueFX's webpage](https://www.truefx.com/truefx-historical-downloads/).
- An executive summary of my MSc Thesis, which highlights the main findings on my research on this topic.

### Abstract of my MSc Thesis

In this Thesis we model volatility using high-frequency data from Foreign Exchange (FX) markets. We explore the empirical characteristics of these high-frequency volatility
estimates from scales ranging from a few minutes to a full trading day. We found that volatility in FX markets is rough and that its degree of roughness seems to vary over
time: periods of market turmoil seem to coincide with periods of low roughness. As far as we know, ours is the first study that establishes this property of volatility outside
equity and futures markets. We also conducted a comprehensive forecasting study of daily and intraday volatility in FX markets. Our main finding in this regard is that
it pays off to incorporate both the rough nature and memory component of volatility into its modelling. We also find that volatility in FX markets shows daily and intraday
patterns not seen in equity markets, pointing at the need of additional modelling in FX markets to obtain better forecasts, both at daily and intraday scales.
